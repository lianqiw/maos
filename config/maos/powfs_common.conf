#File powfs_common.conf
#Gather options regarding WFS that are not specific to a certain telescope or AO implementation. 
#powfs. prefix refers to a type of WFS that may have multiple copies (powfs.nwfs) whose properties are specified using wfs. prefix. 
#Geometric WFS mode uses wavefront to determine gradients directly. Noises are added to gradients using powfs.neasim.
#Physicsl optics WFS mode forms subaperture images and using pixel processing to determine gradients. Noises are added as photon and read out noise. powfs.neasim is not used.

#Acronym list
#SA: subaperture
#SAA: Subaperture normalized area (max at 1)
#NEA: WFS noise equivalent angle.
